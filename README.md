This project is a simple Python program that allows users to compare two cars based on their attributes such as price, year, and top speed. The program consists of three main files:

          1. car.py: Defines the Car class with attributes and a method to display car information.

          2. utility.py: Contains utility functions to compare cars based on price, year, and speed.

          3. program.py: Main script that creates Car objects and performs comparisons.
